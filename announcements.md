## Upcoming Events

### Thriving at College Seminar
The Thriving at College workshop will cover the core concepts of Alex's book by the same name.
It will present a practical roadmap for launching into fruitful, God-honoring adulthood against the backdrop of a young adult culture that values delayed adolescence.

* **When:** November 8th, 3:00-7:00pm
* **Where:** Zeke's Ames
* **Cost:** $15/student (advance - online)
* **Registration:** *www.stonebrook.org/thriving*

### Food at Homegroup
Food isn't free and it doesn't make itself!
We try to keep meals cheap (about 1$/meal), and we ask for a suggested donation of $20 to cover your meals for the semester.

We're also always looking for volunteers to help prepare food and cook!
Let Brian or Chelsea know if you would be available to help.
