### Technology and the Glory of God Seminar
Do you often feel like our computers, phones, and gadgets cause more problems than they solve?
Do you fear or have you fallen victim to the dangers they pose to our privacy and purity
?

Technology pervades life.
It always has.
How can we use it to glorify God rather than enslave ourselves?
These are the two options.

We are excited to host authors Tim Challies and Matt Perman to help us think through these issues, and come away equipped to guard against the potential harms and maximize our effectiveness in the use of technology for The Glory of God.

* **When:** December 6th, 1-7pm
* **Where:** Stonebrook Community Church
* **Cost:** $25 regular, $10 students

### Food at Homegroup
Food isn't free and it doesn't make itself!
We try to keep meals cheap (about 1$/meal), and we ask for a suggested donation of $20 to cover your meals for the semester.
