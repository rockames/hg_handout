\textbf{Thy Mercy My God}

Thy mercy, my God, is the theme of my song, \\
The joy of my heart, and the boast of my tongue; \\
Thy free grace alone, from the first to the last, \\
Hath won my affections, and bound my soul fast. \\

Without Thy sweet mercy I could not live here; \\
Sin would reduce me to utter despair; \\
But, through Thy free goodness, my spirits revive, \\
And He that first made me still keeps me alive. \\

Thy mercy is more than a match for my heart, \\
Which wonders to feel its own hardness depart; \\
Dissolved by Thy goodness, I fall to the ground, \\
And weep to the praise of the mercy I've found.\\

Great Father of mercies, Thy goodness I own, \\
And the covenant love of Thy crucified Son; \\
All praise to the Spirit, Whose whisper divine \\
Seals mercy, and pardon, and righteousness mine. \\

All praise to the Spirit, Whose whisper divine \\
Seals mercy, and pardon, and righteousness mine. \\
