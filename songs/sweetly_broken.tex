\textbf{Sweetly Broken}

To the cross I look, to the cross I cling \\
Of it's suffering I do drink \\
Of it's work I do sing \\

For on it my Savior both bruised and crushed \\
Showed that God is love \\
And God is just \\

\textit{Chorus:}

At the cross You beckon me \\
You draw me gently to my knees, and I am \\
Lost for words, so lost in love, \\
I’m sweetly broken, wholly surrendered \\

What a priceless gift, undeserved life \\
Have I been given \\
Through Christ crucified \\

You’ve called me out of death \\
You’ve called me into life \\
And I was under Your wrath \\
Now through the cross I’m reconciled \\

\textit{Chorus}

In awe of the cross I must confess \\
How wondrous Your redeeming love and \\
How great is Your faithfulness \\
