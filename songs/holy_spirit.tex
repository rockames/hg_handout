\textbf{Holy Spirit}

Holy Spirit, living breath of God, \\
Breathe new life into my willing soul. \\
Let the presence of the risen Lord, \\
Come renew my heart and make me whole. \\
Cause Your Word to come alive in me; \\
Give me faith for what I cannot see, \\
Give me passion for Your purity; \\
Holy Spirit, breathe new life in me. \\

Holy Spirit, come abide within, \\
May Your joy be seen in all I do. \\
Love enough to cover every sin, \\
In each thought and deed and attitude. \\
Kindness to the greatest and the least, \\
Gentleness that sows the path of peace. \\
Turn my strivings into works of grace; \\
Breath of God show Christ in all I do. \\

Holy Spirit, from creation's birth, \\
Giving life to all that God has made, \\
Show Your power once again on earth, \\
Cause Your church to hunger for your ways. \\
Let the fragrance of our prayers arise; \\
Lead us on the road of sacrifice, \\
That in unity the face of Christ \\
May be clear for all the world to see. \\
