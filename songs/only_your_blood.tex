\textbf{Only Your Blood}

I am ashamed, conceived in sin, I’ve always been. \\
Born in a world where Adam’s fall corrupts us. \\
Rooted is the seed of death in life’s first breath. \\
The law demands a perfect heart, but I'm defiled in every part \\

For only Your blood is enough to cover my sin \\
Only Your blood is enough to cover me \\

All this guilt disturbs my peace; I find no release. \\
Who will save me from my crime? I’m helpless. \\
Behold, I fall before Your face in need of grace. \\
So speak to me in a gentle voice, for in Your mercies I rejoice. \\

For only Your blood is enough to cover my sin \\
Only Your blood is enough to cover me \\

Lord, create my heart anew (Father, come and make us wise) \\
Only You are pure and true (Lead us away from our demise) \\
Lord, You are the remedy (For only your blood can set us free) \\

For only Your blood can set us free; only Your blood can set us free \\

No bleeding bird, no bleeding beast \\
No hyssop branch, no priest, \\
No running brook, no flood, no sea \\
Can wash away this stain from me \\

For only Your blood is enough to cover my sin \\
For only Your blood is enough to cover me \\
