# Discussion
The believer in Jesus Christ has been sealed with the Holy Spirit of God as a pledge of the glories that are to come.
He indwells them, literally.
And he is not just "sittin' around doin' nuthin."
Instead, he is highly active as he comforts, encourages, teaches, helps, and empowers us.
How does he do all this?
Is it only through the miraculous and some clear "voice" we hear?
We'll study today how the Spirit will guide our lives through the more ordinary means of life, but if we’re not living with a heart of expectancy, we will miss his guidance.

## Questions

Read Isaiah 11:2

* What qualities does the Holy Spirit have?
How then is he a direct help to the believer in Jesus?

Read 2 Peter 1:21 and 2 Timothy 3:16-17.

* The Holy Spirit is the author of Scripture, and the Scriptures are at the center of his guidance of our lives. Give a specific example of how the Spirit has led your life through his Word, e.g., a time when he encouraged or comforted or corrected you. 

* Discuss ways that we can make the Bible more central to our daily walk with God over the next month. 

* How can others help us do this?
How can we help others?
How can we as a small group work together?

Isaiah 11:2 and other passages reveal that the Holy Spirit is all-wise with insights into virtually every problem, situation, and choice we might encounter. 

Read Proverbs 2:1-15.

* How do we gain God’s wisdom? How then does his wisdom guide us in daily decisions, including decisions we must make in choosing good over evil?

* We are commanded to walk by, be led by, live by, keep in step with, and be filled with the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:16-25 and Ephesians 5:18).
How does a general trust (faith) in God relate to obeying these commands?
How do we keep ourselves from a lack of awareness of and expectancy in the Spirit? How does prayer and worship relate to the Spirit’s guidance?
* Can you think of examples in the Bible where the Lord gave his people direction as they were praying and worshiping?

## Prayer

Worship the Lord for his presence, power, and wisdom through the Holy Spirit. Then pray for a greater awareness of and faith in the Lord to lead and guide us by his Spirit. Pray we would learn how to walk in, live by, and grow in.
