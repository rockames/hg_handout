# Discussion
One of the great questions of life is, Is it worth it? Is life worth it? Is the work I do at my job and in my
relationships worth it? And we bring the same questions into the Christian life, and then add another 
question: Is my service to and love for God and others worth it? The Scriptures give us a resounding, 
“Yes!” The Lord promises over and over to those who walk by faith that he will reward them for their 
work done for him. These promises are not our only motivation for serving the Lord, but they certainly 
are important ones.

## Prayer

Pray for one another that each of us would know that serving the Lord will be worth it in the end. Pray 
that, with this in mind, we wouldn't lose heart as we encounters trials and even persecution.
