# Discussion
The gospel is, in part, a story of suffering.
From eternity, God had planned to create creatures made in his image.
These creatures, i.e., us, then rebelled, and so they suffered, receiving a curse from God, the curse of death.
But God also mercifully sent his Son to suffer and die on our behalf.
But then the Son rose from the dead to conquer our enemy named death.

Since then, millions of followers of Jesus Christ have believed and proclaimed this message of suffering and victory—a message that leads to eternal life for anyone who believes it.
These followers, beginning with the apostles, have been willing to endure suffering for the name of Jesus and for the sake of those who are dying.
And this willingness should shock and inspire us.  

Today let's study and discuss this topic.
And let's pray for those currently suffering around the world for the name of Jesus.
(And if you have time, read the article below.)

## Discussion
* Read Luke 8:30-39 and Acts 1:8.
What compels us to speak about Jesus Christ to a dying world?

* Read Matthew 5:10-12 and Acts 5:40-42.
How are we blessed when we are persecuted for our faith in Jesus?
What promises does the Lord give to those who suffer?
How can we grow to have such willingness to endure persecution?

* Read Hebrews 10:32-36 and 13:3.
What are we called to do?

## Prayer
First, let's pray that the Holy Spirit would increase our compassion for our brothers and sisters suffering for the sake of Jesus, and that we would not be ignorant or cold-hearted towards them.
Second, let's pray for these believers.
Particularly, today let's pray for Christians in countries where Islamist extremists are most violent.
Some of these countries are Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Philippines, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kenya, and Somalia.
See below for some prayer requests suggested by Voice of the Martyrs ministry.
Third, pray that we would have such love for Jesus Christ and people and such boldness that we would proclaim Christ regardless of the consequences.
