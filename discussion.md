# Discussion
We are beginning a 3 week series on Heaven.
Some of the teaching will be "fact checking" the book Heaven by Randy Alcorn.

Let's first discuss our perceptions of heaven.
Think back to your life before Christ.
What was your perception of heaven?
How has your perception of heaven changed after you placed your faith in Christ?

Thinking about the "logistics" of heaven can sometimes be mentally exhausting.
The sinful world we live in has tainted our ability to understand how our world would operate without sin, pain, sadness, hunger, greed, etc.
Dave walked us through a series of old testament passages that discuss heaven (listed below).
These passages begin to paint a picture of heaven.
Take some time to read & discuss these passages.   

* Genesis 1:1-2, 26-28, 31; 4:17
* Isaiah 2:2-4; 11:1-16; 26:19; 60:1-5, 10-14, 18-22; 65:17, 20
* Daniel 12:1-3;13
* 2 Peter 3:13

Discuss why it is important for Christians to have a biblical understanding of heaven.
(Some possible lines of discussion would be the character of God, suffering through trials, witnessing to the lost, etc.)

The thought of heaven can be so attractive to us as we are able to dream about a world without sin, pain, & trials.
Share with one another how the truth of heaven helps you endure/respond to our current world of sin & pain?

## Prayer
Take time to pray together as a group for a deeper understanding in heaven and to be reminded of Godâ€™s goodness.
