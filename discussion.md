> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh...
> If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. 
> -- Galatians 5:16,25  ESV  

Paul (the apostle, not the pastor) commands us in Galatians to walk by the Spirit and live by the Spirit, and yet this may seem somewhat mysterious or vague to us.
And perhaps some mystery is appropriate because this relationship is with someone that we cannot see or feel.
But surely walking by the Spirit is more obvious and straightforward than we might first think, for God has commanded us to live this way, and he doesn’t give impossible commands.

## Questions 
The commands in the Bible to walk are not uncommon:   walk by faith, walk in the light, walk in love, walk in good works, and more.
Walking means that we are moving, going somewhere.  It’s another way to state simply, “live life.”  And it means that we are simply taking one step at a time, and doing this over and over again.  So with this in mind, let’s consider how to walk in the Spirit.

Read Colossians 2:6-7.
Paul here connects the beginning of our relationship with Christ to our ongoing relationship.
In other words, how we received Christ is instructive on how we are to walk in Christ.
So let’s start with the day of our salvation.

* What attitudes of mind and heart should we bring before God when we call out to him to save us?
What views of God?
Of ourselves?
* So now connect this to our daily walk with Christ.
How should we walk in him?

On Sunday, Paul (the pastor, not the apostle) connected Colossians 2:6-7 to our topic of walking by the Spirit, giving us four action points.
As we discuss these four points, keep in mind the Holy Spirit’s role in our lives.

1. Being humble.
Read 1 Peter 5:5-7.
How can we walk humbly, acknowledging the presence of the Holy Spirit and living by his power?
How does the Holy Spirit humble us?
How does pride change our walk?
2. Learning and believing the truth.
Read 2 Timothy 3:16-17.
The Holy Spirit is the author of the Scriptures, so he will use his words in the Bible to lead and guide us.
How does acknowledging the Holy Spirit’s wisdom and authority in the Scriptures shape how we learn and believe the truth?
3. Obeying.
Read Ephesians 2:8-10;  James 1:22-25.
The New Testament is clear:  our works do not save us.
But works and obedience are the fruit of genuine faith.
For the believer in Christ, what is the difference between obeying in our own power and by the power and wisdom of the Spirit?
4. Proclaiming.
Acts 1:8 and Acts 4:19-20.
How does the Spirit empower us to speak about the Lord?
What happens to our proclamation if we do not rely upon the Spirit?

So with this discussion so far, and combing this with other biblical truth about the Holy Spirit and living out the Christian life, how would you summarize what our lives look like as we walk by the Spirit?

##Prayer
Worship the Lord for his presence, power, and wisdom through the Holy Spirit.
Then pray for a greater awareness of his presence and a willingness to be led by him.
Pray we would learn how to walk in, live by, and be filled with the Spirit.
Finally, pray for each other in any particular areas that you want to grow in.
