# Discussion

On Sunday morning, Pastor Dave Bovenmyer gave a sermon entitled “The Helper has Come”.
He shared a story about losing his keys and cell phone while mowing the lawn.
After praying and asking the Lord for help, he quickly found his phone on the riding lawn mower, but not his keys.
He looked throughout the house and all his pockets: no keys.
He knew they must be in the yard.
While walking his large yard, he continued to pray.
An image popped into his head of his keys sitting next to a lilac bush.
He ignored the thought and kept walking.
The thought of his keys near the lilac bush kept coming back.
Eventually he decided enough was enough and checked near the bush!
And found his keys.

## Questions

* Occasionally we might have situations like this, or we might not.
Have you ever had something like this happen to you?

* How do we know when we’re experiencing the Holy Spirit or if something is just coincidence?

The Holy Spirit gives us an opportunity to be closer to God than any other person.
We can spend a lot of time with our spouse or close friends, but the Holy Spirit is inside us.
Sometimes we ignore the Holy Spirit, or just don't sense him in our lives.
As believers, we should have close fellowship with God through the Holy Spirit.

* What are some reasons why we might not have close fellowship?
* What are some ways we can grow that relationship closer?

## Even more Questions (if time allows)
* In what ways does the Spirit's role as the Helper impact your relationship with God?
How can we cultivate a stronger sense of the recognition of the Spirit's personhood?
* What are some wrong impressions we may have about how the Holy Spirit guides us?
What should we do when two believers have conflicting views of what God's will is in a particular situation?
