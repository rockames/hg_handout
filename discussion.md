# Discussion

On Sunday morning Paul Johnson gave the first sermon of a 7 week series on the Holy Spirit, discussing the Who, What, When, Where, and Why of the Holy Spirit.

For myself, one particular encounter with the Holy Spirit stands out among all the others; it was one of my earliest.
After weeks of consideration, late one Friday night after The Rock I decided to be baptized.
A few leaders suggested we do it right away, someone else also expressed desire.
Six weeks earlier, I had put my trust in Christ and positioned him as my Lord.  

As I walked back to my Towers dorm room I remembered my roommate was having a party in our room.
I felt enormous dread and anxiety, not wanting to explain to a room of half sober college students that I was collecting my things at 10 o'clock on a Friday night to be baptized in a river (well...a creek).
I can clearly remember the Holy Spirit prompting me to obey God and to trust him with the consequences, whatever they may be.
