Before Jesus finished his earthly ministry, he told the disciples in John 16:7:

 > ``It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you.''

Essentially, he is saying that we are better off to have the Helper, the Holy Spirit.
This reveals the importance of the Holy Spirit to us, yet we often are either ignorant or misunderstand, or perhaps even underestimate, the Spiritâ€™s presence and role in our lives.
This series is to go deeper with God through the Spirit. 

## Read Colossians 1:11-14

We have been saved from the domain of darkness and transferred to the kingdom of the Son, the kingdom of light.

* What other contrasts are there as part of salvation in Christ, i.e., from what to what?
* How should these contrasts and our position in Christ affect our view towards life?
* How are we different than before? 

## Read 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 

* How has our identity and standing before God changed?
* What are the implications and outcome of being washed, sanctified, and justified?
* How does all this affect our conduct? 

## Read Galatians 5:16-26 
* Discuss the conflict between the Spirit's desires and our fleshly desires. 
* Contrast the two lists: the deeds of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit.
* How do they differ?
* How does the Holy Spirit enable us to live fruitful lives?
* What does it mean to walk by the Spirit (vs. 16,25), live by the Spirit (vs. 25), and be filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5:19)?
